  ## Description
  An application for easily creating employee security badges via API or manual entries.

  ## Usage
  To use this application, open the terminal and navigate to the CatWorx.BadgeMaker folder. After navigating, enter <code>dotnet run</code> in the terminal to start the application. The user will be presented with a question for whether they would like to populate the badges via API (random generator), or if they would like to create them manually. The user can enter <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>. If the user enters <code>yes</code> in the terminal, the app will generate 10 badges with the fetched API, which is currently a random generator. These badges will be created in the <code>data</code> folder of the Badge-Maker app. If the user selects <code>no</code>, then they will be asked a series of 4 questions for firstname, lastname, employee ID number, and the picture to be used for the badge. This picture can be saved in the root directory of the app and entered accordingly, the 300.jfif photo was used in example. Once the information has been entered, the questions will run again if the user would like to enter more than one employee for creating a badge. If the user would like to exit, simply hit enter at the firstname question to exit and create the badge, as listed in the question prompt. Badges created manually will also be in the <code>data</code> folder of the Badge-Maker app.
